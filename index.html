            <p>
                Bright Minds Journal was created as a calm, supportive space
                where you can check in with yourself each day.
            </p>

            <p>
                Here, you can reflect on your mood, write freely without judgment,
                and receive daily positive messages designed to encourage,
                reassure, and support your mental wellbeing.
            </p>

            <p>
                There is no pressure to write perfectly — this space is for honesty,
                growth, and self-care, at your own pace.
            </p>
